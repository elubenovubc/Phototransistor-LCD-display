# Phototransistor-LCD-display
A 16x2 LCD displays the light going through a phototransistor in percent.

First ever GitHub upload, so I hope all follows standard.

You will find the code in PhotoTransistorIMarked.ino - It comes with some comments explaining the thought process. You may have noticed the I in the file; I intend to improve the model later, as it increases percentage in increments of 17%. Not the worst, but could be better.

Phototransistor Schematic.pdf is where you can find the electrical schematic diagram. I also have a pretty faithful tinkercad replica here for you to interact with:

PhotoTransistorP1 to P5 are some photos I took of the system.
PhotoTransistorV1 and V2 are some videos I took.

Thanks for checking this out!
